Introduction
This project implements edge detection and object segmentation using two different platforms, Python and MATLAB, to analyze and compare their performance. The primary objective is to:

Detect edges in images using the Canny Edge Detection Algorithm.
Segment objects from edge-detected images using contours and connected regions.
Evaluate results using metrics such as Edge Density, Mean Gradient Magnitude, Number of Objects, and Average Object Size. The project showcases the advantages and limitations of Python and MATLAB for computer vision tasks, providing insights into their capabilities in handling edge detection and segmentation workflows.
Dataset
Name: Natural Images Dataset
Source: Public dataset repository.
Size: 6,899 images.
Categories: Airplanes, Cars, People, Flowers, and Buildings.
Preprocessing:
All images were converted to grayscale to standardize edge detection.
A subset of 5 images was used for testing and visualization.
Purpose: The dataset's diversity makes it ideal for evaluating edge detection and segmentation performance across different object types.
Methodology
Python Implementation
Edge Detection:
Used OpenCVâ€™s cv2.Canny() for Canny Edge Detection.
Calculated metrics:
Edge Density: Ratio of edge pixels to total pixels.
Mean Gradient Magnitude: Computed using Sobel filters (cv2.Sobel()).
Object Segmentation:
Extracted contours using cv2.findContours().
Filtered small contours to remove noise.
Visualized segmented objects by overlaying green contours on the original images.
Metrics calculated:
Number of Objects.
Average Object Size.
MATLAB Implementation
Edge Detection:
Used the edge() function for Canny Edge Detection.
Calculated metrics:
Edge Density: Ratio of edge pixels.
Mean Gradient Magnitude: Computed using Sobel gradients (imgradientxy).
Object Segmentation:
Used bwconncomp() to identify connected components in edge-detected images.
Visualized segmented objects with green contours overlaid on the original images.
Metrics calculated:
Number of Objects.
Average Object Size.
Metrics and Results
Edge Detection Metrics:
Edge Density: Quantifies the prominence of edges.
Mean Gradient Magnitude: Measures average gradient intensity.
Segmentation Metrics:
Number of Objects: Total objects segmented.
Average Object Size: Mean area of segmented objects.
